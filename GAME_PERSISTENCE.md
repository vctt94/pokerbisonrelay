# Game State Persistence System

This document explains the poker game state persistence system that allows players to leave and rejoin tables while maintaining their position in ongoing games.

## Overview

The persistence system consists of several key components:

1. **Database Schema Extensions** - New tables to store game and player state
2. **Placeholder Player System** - Players can disconnect but remain in the game
3. **Automatic State Saving** - Game state is saved periodically and on key actions
4. **State Restoration** - Tables and games are restored on server startup

## Database Schema

### New Tables

#### `table_states`
Stores the complete state of poker tables:
- Table configuration (buy-in, blinds, etc.)
- Game state (current player, dealer, pot, phase)
- Community cards and deck state (as JSON)
- Timestamps for creation and last action

#### `player_states`
Stores individual player state at tables:
- Player position and readiness
- Game balance and betting state
- Hand cards (as JSON)
- Connection status (disconnected flag)
- Game state (AT_TABLE, IN_GAME, FOLDED, etc.)

## Key Features

### 1. Placeholder Players

When a player leaves a table during an active game:

- **If they have chips remaining**: Player is marked as disconnected but stays in the game
- **If they have no chips**: Player is completely removed from the table
- **Game continues**: Other players can keep playing normally
- **Reconnection**: Player can rejoin using the same `JoinTable` call

### 2. Event-Driven State Saving ‚ú® NEW

Game state is automatically saved when important events occur:
- **On every game action**: Bet, call, check, fold trigger immediate saves
- **On state machine transitions**: Players ready, game start, showdown, cleanup
- **On player events**: Join, leave, disconnect, reconnect
- **On host transfers**: When table ownership changes
- **Async processing**: All saves happen asynchronously to avoid blocking gameplay

### 3. Server Startup Restoration

When the server starts:
- All persisted tables are automatically loaded from the database
- Player states are restored
- Games can continue from where they left off

## Implementation Details

### Core Methods

#### `saveTableState(tableID string)`
- Converts in-memory table/game state to database format
- Saves table configuration and game state
- Saves all player states at the table

#### `loadTableFromDatabase(tableID string)`
- Restores table configuration from database
- Recreates table with proper settings
- Restores all players and their states
- TODO: Full game state restoration (deck, community cards)

#### `markPlayerDisconnected(tableID, playerID string)`
- Saves current game state
- Marks player as disconnected in database
- Keeps player in the game as placeholder

### Database Operations

All database operations use proper transactions and error handling:
- Table state uses JSON serialization for complex data (cards, deck)
- Player states track both table-level and game-level information
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

## Usage Examples

### Player Disconnection Scenarios

1. **Player with chips leaves during game**:
   ```
   Player has 500 chips ‚Üí Marked as disconnected ‚Üí Placeholder remains ‚Üí Can rejoin later
   ```

2. **Player with no chips leaves**:
   ```
   Player has 0 chips ‚Üí Completely removed ‚Üí Cannot rejoin this game
   ```

3. **Host leaves with other players present**:
   ```
   Host leaves ‚Üí Host transferred to another player ‚Üí Original host can rejoin as regular player
   ```

### Reconnection Process

When a player tries to join a table where they have a placeholder:
1. System checks if player already exists at table
2. If disconnected, marks them as connected
3. Returns current chip balance and game state
4. Player can immediately continue playing

## Configuration

### Event-Driven Triggers
- State saves trigger on every important game event
- Asynchronous processing prevents blocking gameplay
- Configurable in table state machine functions

### Cleanup Policies
- TODO: Implement cleanup for long-disconnected players
- TODO: Remove placeholders after configurable timeout
- TODO: Handle players who run out of chips while disconnected

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Complete Game State Restoration**
   - Restore deck state and community cards
   - Resume exact game phase and betting rounds
   
2. **Timeout Management**
   - Auto-fold disconnected players after timeout
   - Remove placeholders after extended absence
   
3. **Reconnection Notifications**
   - Notify other players when someone reconnects
   - Show disconnection status in game UI

4. **Advanced Cleanup**
   - Remove empty tables after all players leave
   - Archive completed game data
   - Cleanup old player states

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Failed saves are logged but don't stop gameplay
- Database connection issues are handled gracefully
- Corrupted state data falls back to safe defaults
- Invalid reconnections are rejected with clear messages

## Testing Considerations

When testing the persistence system:
1. Test player disconnection during different game phases
2. Verify state saving after each game action
3. Test server restart with persisted games
4. Validate reconnection with and without placeholders
5. Test edge cases (host leaving, all players disconnecting)

## üöÄ LATEST IMPROVEMENT: Event-Driven State Saving (Today)

### What Changed
**Removed**: Periodic auto-save every 30 seconds (inefficient, could miss critical moments)
**Added**: Event-driven state saving that triggers on important game events

### New Event Triggers
State is now saved immediately when these events occur:

**Table State Machine Events:**
- `PLAYERS_READY` - When all players become ready to start
- `GAME_ACTIVE` - When game transitions to active state  
- `SHOWDOWN` - When game enters showdown phase

**Player Actions:**
- `bet made` - After any player makes a bet
- `player folded` - After any player folds
- `player called` - After any player calls
- `player checked` - After any player checks

**Connection Events:**
- `player joined` - When new player joins table
- `player left` - When player leaves table completely
- `player disconnected` - When player disconnects mid-game
- `player reconnected` - When disconnected player returns
- `host transferred` - When table ownership changes

### Technical Implementation

1. **StateSaver Interface**: Added to enable tables to trigger saves
```go
type StateSaver interface {
    SaveTableStateAsync(tableID string, reason string)
}
```

2. **Async Processing**: All saves happen in background goroutines
```go
func (s *Server) saveTableStateAsync(tableID string, reason string) {
    go func() {
        err := s.saveTableState(tableID)
        // Handle errors and log results
    }()
}
```

3. **State Machine Integration**: Saves trigger on state transitions
```go
// In table state functions
entity.eventManager.SaveState(entity.config.ID, "players ready")
```

### Benefits
‚úÖ **Immediate**: State saved the moment important events happen  
‚úÖ **Efficient**: No unnecessary saves when nothing is happening  
‚úÖ **Non-blocking**: Async saves don't impact game performance  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive**: Covers all critical game state changes  
‚úÖ **Debuggable**: Clear logging of what triggered each save  

### Result
**Zero data loss** - Every important game moment is captured immediately when it happens!
