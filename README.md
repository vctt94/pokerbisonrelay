# Poker Bot for Bison Relay

A poker bot implementation for the Bison Relay network that allows users to play poker games using their balance.

## Features

- Player balance management
- Table creation and joining
- Texas Hold'em poker game implementation
- gRPC API for game operations
- SQLite database for persistence

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- Protocol Buffers compiler (protoc)
- SQLite3

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vctt94/pokerbisonrelay.git
cd pokerbisonrelay
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Generate gRPC code:
```bash
./generate.sh
```

### Running the Server

Start the poker server:
```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

The server will start listening on port 50051 by default. You can change the port and database path using flags:
```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go -port :50052 -db custom.db
```

### Running the Client

Test the service using the client:
```bash
go run cmd/client/main.go
```

You can specify the server address and player ID:
```bash
go run cmd/client/main.go -server localhost:50052 -player my-player
```
